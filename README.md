# Cerberus 2.0
A precise low-drift Visual-Inertial-Leg Odometry for legged robots

This is an improved version of [Cerberus](https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/Cerberus). It is based on the following publications:

* **Multi-IMU Proprioceptive Odometry for Legged Robots**, Yang, Shuo and Zhang, Zixin and Bokser, Benjamin,  and Manchester, Zachary. (submitted to IROS 2023) 

* **Cerberus: Low-Drift Visual-Inertial-Leg Odometry For Agile Locomotion**, Yang, Shuo and Zhang, Zixin and Fu, Zhengyu and Manchester, Zachary. (ICRA 2023) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07654)
